                        <p>Airlines carry an enormous volume of passengers and goods. In 2023 nearly 97,000 scheduled flights departed daily worldwide, carrying about 12.1 million passengers per day. Annually that was roughly 4.4 billion airline passengers. For example, U.S. carriers alone operate ~27,000 flights daily with 2.7 million passengers. Asia-Pacific is the largest air-travel market (1.4 billion passengers in 2023, ~34.7% of global), followed by Europe (988 million, ~26%) and North America (773 million, ~23%). In total, about 29,000 commercial jet airliners were in service globally in 2023. These aircraft have typical average seating loads around 82–83%, so on a 120-seat plane roughly 100 seats are filled on average.</p>
                        
                        <p>Each passenger brings luggage. Survey data indicate a mean adult passenger + carry-on ≈84 kg, plus an average checked bag of ~16 kg. In practice, not every traveler uses the full allowance (e.g. 20–30 kg allowed), so some payload capacity goes unused. In terms of volume, belly holds of passenger jets typically accommodate a few to several tonnes of cargo. For example, narrow-body airliners carry on the order of 2–4 tonnes of freight in the belly, whereas modern wide-bodies (A350, B777, etc.) carry roughly 10–15 tonnes (for context, dedicated cargo freighters range up to ~100 t.). As one analysis notes, airlines “generate revenue from unused space” by carrying cargo in passenger jets. Indeed, passenger airplanes account for about half of air cargo capacity worldwide: in 2018 roughly 48% of airline freight (by tonne-kilometer) was belly cargo, and even after the pandemic it’s still on that order (~50%).</p>

                            <figcaption class="climate-caption">Passenger jets often carry freight in belly holds. Here a Northwest (Delta) Boeing 747 is being loaded with cargo before a passenger flight. Wide-body jets like this can carry ~10–15 t of belly cargo. Industry data show roughly half of global air freight travels in such bellies. Per passenger, the average total weight (person + baggage) is only ~100 kg (≈84 kg passenger plus 16 kg checked bag on average), so many flights have additional unused mass capacity. In short, every commercial passenger flight today carries millions of travelers and their bags – yet typically with room to spare for additional cargo in the hold.</figcaption>

                        <p>Airlines move vast quantities of freight and mail. In 2023 carriers transported about 61.4 million tonnes of air cargo. Including mail and parcels raises that total to roughly 65.6 million tonnes per year. For perspective, U.S. airlines alone fly on the order of 61,000 tonnes of cargo every single day. These volumes reflect high-value, time-sensitive goods: air freight represents about 35% of world trade by value but under 1% by weight.</p>
                        
                        <figure class="climate-figure">

                            <figcaption class="climate-caption">Major integrator cargo jets (e.g. this FedEx 777F) carry hundreds of tonnes of freight each. In 2024 FedEx Express flew some 18.1 billion cargo ton-km, making it the world’s top cargo airline. Global airlines collectively shipped ~65.6 million tonnes of cargo+mail in 2023. Cargo airlines (FedEx, UPS, Cathay, etc.) operate thousands of dedicated freighter flights daily. But as noted, a similar quantity of freight moves in passenger bellies. Postal services in many countries rely on the airline network: for example, USPS and other postal operators contract with air carriers to carry priority mail on cargo and passenger flights. The IATA/UPU partnership highlights that airlines handle all mail flown by air: “airlines transport more than 65.6 million tonnes of cargo and mail annually”[12]. In the U.S., postal airmail is handled by carriers like FedEx and UPS under contract (so letters travel in cargo holds or scheduled freighters).</figcaption>

                        <p>In short, billions of passenger flights and millions of tonnes of cargo move every year. Tens of thousands of these flights could, in principle, carry extra mail/parcels in their unused belly or baggage capacity, instead of scheduling separate trucking or freighter trips. For example, if each of 100,000 daily passenger flights took on just 1–2 extra tonnes, that would add 100–200,000 tonnes/day of freight capacity – comparable to or exceeding current dedicated cargo operations. All of this flying occurs on existing schedules, so using the space avoids many additional emissions.</p>

                        <p>Freight transport by air is very carbon-intensive per tonne. For illustration, moving a small 2 kg package 1000 km emits about 4.42 kg CO₂ if flown by air, compared to only 0.21 kg by truck or 0.03 kg by container ship. In general, aviation (passenger and cargo combined) accounts for about 11.6% of all transportation CO₂, whereas road transport (mostly cars and buses) is ~75%. Rail and shipping are far cleaner: rail freight is ~1% of transport emissions.</p>
                        
                        <p>By loading packages onto already-scheduled passenger flights, carriers can avoid separate cargo trips (which would burn even more fuel). Airlines note that belly freight “reduces overhead costs associated with dedicated freighters” – in climate terms, this means fewer flights overall. For example, a fully loaded Boeing 777F consumes only a fraction more fuel per tonne than the same airplane empty, so adding extra cargo to full passenger flights has low marginal emissions.</p>
                        
                        <p>Nevertheless, air freight remains carbon-intensive. Shifting goods transport to lower-carbon modes (rail, ship) is preferable. For perspective, road freight emits ~20× less CO₂ per tonne-km than air. Because of this, logistics planners reserve air cargo for high-value or urgent shipments. The key mitigation point here is avoiding extra flights: by using spare belly capacity on flights that are going anyway, postal companies could prevent dedicated flights or long truck hauls.</p>

                <!-- Conclusion -->

                    <div class="climate-details-content">
                        <p>Passenger planes account for on the order of 100,000 flights per day worldwide. Each carries passengers plus luggage and has bellies that can hold several tonnes of cargo. In 2023 airlines carried ~61 million tonnes of freight (65.6 Mt including mail). Millions of tons of mail already ride in those holds, but substantial spare capacity exists. If postal companies could systematically book that spare space (instead of scheduling new freight trucks or flights), many extra trips could be avoided – saving fuel and CO₂. However, even with optimization, air shipments remain more carbon-intensive per kilo than ground or sea. Thus the greatest climate benefit comes from shifting as much freight as feasible to lower-carbon modes, and using passenger flights only to absorb shipments that would otherwise require separate flights.</p>
